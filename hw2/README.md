# HW2 - COMP 4610 GUI I - Pacific Trails Resort CSS Styling

## Name:
Xavier Freitas

## Description:
Used CSS to turn a bland HTML website into a nicely styled and approachable website advertising Pacific Trails Resort. In doing so I learned a lot about styling webpages including styling navigation bars, using grid display, formatting lists, margins/paddings/borders, relative sizes, and more.
